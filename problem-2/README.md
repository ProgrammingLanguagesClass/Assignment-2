## Problem 2
Write code to find the grade of a student given their score as follows:

- 85 <= Excellent <= 100
- 75 <= Very Good < 85
- 65 <= Good < 75
- 50 <= Pass < 65
- 0 <= Fail < 50

**Note:** A score greater than 100 or less than 0 is not a valid score and should return a message `Not valid`

Edit the **getGrade( )** function in the **main.cpp** file. The function takes the score as input and returns a string **grade** as the output. *Do not write a main function*.
Only edit the part marked with `\\ Write your code here`
